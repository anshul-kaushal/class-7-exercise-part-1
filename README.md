THE GODFATHER 1 TRIVIA 

Question 1: What makes Godfather 1 so great?

Question 2: How did Vito conclude that Emilio Barzini was the one to order the
hit on his eldest son, Santino Corleone?

Answer 2: From how I see it, initially, it was assumed that Don Tattaglia was the one who was backing the mobster Sollozzo in New York for his narcotics business and also the one who ordered the hit on Santino Corleone, Don Corleone’s son, as a retaliation for Santino Corleone ordering the assassination of his son. 

However, this particular assumption wasn’t sitting well with Don Corleone himself. He believed that Tattaglia wasn’t as smart as to outwit his son and that someone else must be controlling the strings here. 

Albeit, his suspicions were confirmed when at the meeting of the heads of the five crime families of the New York, Don Barzini was negotiating harder for the facilitation of the narcotics business than Tattaglia himself, who was just simply going along with the terms Barzini was willing to negotiate peace upon. 

The meeting made it abundantly clear for Don Corleone that Tattaglia was just a puppet, while Barzini was the actual master and hence the real culprit of his 
son’s death. 


Question 3: How did Vito Corleone know that whomever would approach Michael Corleone to set up a meeting with Emilio Barzini would be the traitor?
