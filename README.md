THE GODFATHER 1 TRIVIA 

Question 1: What makes Godfather 1 so great?
Question 2: How did Vito conclude that Emilio Barzini was the one to order the
hit on his eldest son, Santino Corleone?

Question 3: How did Vito Corleone know that whomever would approach Michael Corleone to set up a meeting with Emilio Barzini would be the traitor?

Answer 3: During the meeting of the five families, Don Vito Corleone realised that it was actually Barzini who wanted the Corleone family’s political influence and legal protection to ensure the smooth functioning of the narcotics business. He concluded that in the long run, Barzini wanted to eliminate the Corleones completely to acquire the top position in the New York organised-crime setting. As Vito was getting older and weaker, he made his youngest son, Michael, the heir apparent of his crime empire. When empires witness transition of power, they’re usually perceived by the outer forces as well as the inner segments, to be the most vulnerable. Well aware of Barzini’s intentions, Vito knew that after his death, Barzini would make a move to finish off the Corleone family entirely. 

Though he knew Barzini would make a move, he wasn’t exactly sure how. Hence, he, along with Michael, conceived a plan to trap Barzini and force him to make a move that they wanted him to make. Thus, after the transition of power from Vito to Michael, Michael pretended to be a weaker negotiator than his predecessor which sowed the seeds of doubt for Michael’s capabilities in not only the mind of his enemies but also his own sub-ordinates. Originally loyal to Vito and not his son, it was expected that some of the members of the crime family might turn on Michael to protect their own interests as the end of the Corleone family seemed inevitable owing to its weak leadership, that is, Michael. This set the stage for Barzini to make his move by luring in one of Michael’s associate to arrange a meeting between the heads of the two families on the turf of the mediator, the traitor, where Michael was to be assassinated. 

Therefore, while Barzini wanted to use the traitor to get to Michael, Vito used the traitor to get to Barzini instead.
